# Research Compute

## Aoraki Research Compute Cluster

The Research cluster provides researchers with access to shared resources, such as CPUs, GPUs, and high-speed storage on a Linux operating system. Also available are specialised software and libraries optimised for scientific and datascience computing. The cluster is administered and maintained by Research and Teaching IT Support.

Access is through your university account

Documentation regarding the platform is found at https://rtis.cspages.otago.ac.nz/research-computing/

## Virtual Machines

For situations where the Research cluster might not be suitable e.g. a need for Windows specific sogtware, Research and Teaching IT Support can offer the creation and hosting of virtual machines.


## Shiny Web App Hosting

RTIS Solutions manages a ShinyProxy platform; ShinyProxy is a free & open source project that allows for the deployment of data science apps on demand, such as (but not limited to) R Shiny apps at scale, without the restrictions of e.g. the free-tier Posit/Shiny Server.

- Single sign-on authentication using UO credentials, or general public access
- Granular access controls (i.e. which group of users can start which apps)
- No limits on concurrent usage
- Highly-available and scalable, as app instances are run on one of the RTIS-K8s Kubernetes clusters.
